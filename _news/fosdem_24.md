I gave a talk on the 4th of February 2024 within the GCC's devroom at [FOSDEM 24](https://fosdem.org/2024/).

The talk is focusing on the modification I have done within GCC's Static Analyzer in order to implement a constant time analysis on cryptographic code.
It is centered on GCC itself and no heavy cryptography background is required.

I would like to thanks the GCC devroom organizers for giving me the opportunity to present my work at FOSDEM 24!

I invite you to have a look at the [other talks in GCC devroom](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/gcc/) given that day.
Recordings and additional resources is available for each of them, so feel free to check them out!

Here is the recording of my talk:
